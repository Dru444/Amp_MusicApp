# How to access our music player: https://master.d7xapr7zjgjdd.amplifyapp.com/ 
# This Project was developed under the course (CS-3132: Cloud Computing Concepts)


## 1. If you are coming for the first time to our music player, first you have to click on Create account to register your credentials in our database.

## 2. Then register yourself and make sure your username is your E-Mail ID only, other than that it will not authenticate if your username and E-Mail ID fields don’t match.

## 3. Make sure that your password is a minimum of 8 characters long.

## 4. Then after clicking on create an account, you will get a verification code on your registered E-Mail ID which you have to verify on the next screen.

## 5. Then you can access our music player (named as DaaaM) and when you are done you can sign out.

## 6. Now if you have already accessed our music player and you are a returning user then you can normally sign in with your credentials.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
